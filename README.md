# IBM Design System Developer Essentials - Learning Bundle
For creation of Developer Essentials course for Carbon / Front-end Skills


## 0.0  What this is
We're producing a Learning Lab series that will include live content, online tutorials and videos for developers so they learn:
About the IBM Design System
How to build with the IBM Design System
How to contribute to the IBM Design System

Each Learning Lab will be held live in each participating IBM location globally. All participating developers, with a focus on those working in the front end,  at a location will be encouraged to meet together in a single room to participate in the Learning Lab.


### 0.1  What is going on?
Developers need guidance on how to use the IBM Design System to build out the UIs that are being designed using the IBM Design Language. 


### 0.2  Who is involved?
This program is being led and sponsored by Phil Gilbert 
Jeoff Wilks is the Executive Sponsor.
Kelly Churchill and Robin Cannon are responsible for overall planning and implementation. 
Carbon devs will own delivery of content


TODO: Find co-sponsors in Engineering? (exec or high-level, with credibility)


## 1.0  Situational overview


### 1.1  The current situation…


"Where do I start?"  Developers are being given designs from designers who went through the Design Essentials course and are designing in the new Language but do not know how to start implementing those designs (whether from a lack of front end development skills or unfamiliarity with the System itself)


"I object." I have a big product with 200-300 screens. How do I even get started with this?


TODO: how to adopt for an existing UI = show why using the system is easiest for adoption (i.e. steps to adopt new system - change to plex, icons, colors, layout )


"I object."   Some developers are skeptical of the System after a cursory look. For example, they may say contributing is too hard but haven't looked at the Contributing section on the web site or opened an issue.


### 1.2  The IBM Design System Dev Essentials Learning Bundle
This will be the introductory course for developers to learn how to build a UI with the IBM Design System.
(with initial focus on product UI, and evolution towards both product and brand/marketing as the Systems converge more fully)


### 1.3  Hills

HILL 1 — IBM DESIGN SYSTEM ADOPTION AND ADVOCACY
Developers will gain direct experience building UIs with the IBM Design System, and be able to advocate for its use and cite benefits they've experienced personally (e.g. faster development time, a11y, etc.). 

HILL 2 — CONTRIBUTION 
Developers who finish the lab exercises will be contributors to the open source IBM Design System and will continue to contribute on their own. 


HILL 3 — CERTIFICATION OF SKILLS
Developers will earn badges for completion of learning bundles in IBM Design System and front-end development skills so business leaders can assess their team's skill levels.


### 1.4  Participants / Users


Developers, internal and external, who want or need to build UIs with IDL


## 2.0  Program details


### 2.1  Overview

Format: Online Lab Instruction, plus scheduled lab sessions

Leveraging FED@IBM local branch leaders who can be in-room proxies for attendees at these sites:

* Austin, Texas, US  
* Böblingen, Germany 
* Budapest, Hungary 
* Chennai, TN, India 
* Dublin, Ireland
* Hursley, UK  
* Littleton, Massachusetts, US

### 2.2  Dates and timing  

* Launch the program by March 31, 2019
* 10-15 minute presentation to introduce the topics, and the links to syllabus items.
* Coordinate with FED@IBM chapters to arrange on-site developer led sessions to go through these five sections. Also provide resources for individual learning for any developer.

Where possible, try to coordinate these lab learning sessions so that various labs are working in roughly the same timeline.

Outcome: participants will receive badges/credentials of completion

## 3.0  Overview of the content

Approach everything with a huge dose of humility
Show, don't tell. 
Be extra, extra, extra sure to show ACTUAL use cases where developers have used the components 
"Please Give us your feedback"   (that's Hill 3) 
"We know that we haven't thought of everything. There are complexities that we haven't gotten to yet that you're having to deal with. Please give us your feedback."

Schedule will be alternating with FEDucation
