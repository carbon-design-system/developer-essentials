## Format
* Each lab is a tutorial step that we make available in `carbon-website` the day prior
* We have `carbon-tutorial` repo published, and also day prior we publish a new branch for each tutorial step
  * Tutorial repo is configured with Netlify, test runner, and Circle CI
  * The branches act as a starting point for if somebody missed the first lab, etc.
  * The branches also are seeded with failing tests
  * To verify lab completion, participants submit PR that they can view Netlify preview link and CI verifies passing tests
  * Kelly and team review PRs and comment then close instead of merging participant PRs
* Each tutorial should take an hour or two to complete
* Those responsible for each tutorial step will introduce it (10-15 talk) at the broadcasted FED@IBM events
* FED@IBM chapters have on-site developer-led sessions to go through the session's tutorial step
* Outcome: participants will receive badges/credentials of completion
